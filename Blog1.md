## Understanding Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two powerful concepts in modern technology. They're often used interchangeably, but they don't exactly mean the same thing.

AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a "smart" way. It refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think like a human. AI machines have the ability to learn, reason, problem-solve, and possibly even manipulate their environment.

Machine Learning, on the other hand, is an application of AI. It's the concept that we should give machines access to data and let them learn themselves. It's about creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data so that they can make decisions or predictions. 

Moreover, AI is classified into two categories, namely, weak AI and strong AI. While weak AI just mimics human intelligence, relying heavily on basic rules and limited commands, Strong AI aims to genuinely simulate human reasoning and can solve complex tasks.

Machine Learning further branches out into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Each has its unique way of learning from the data and serving a specific purpose.

Together, AI and ML are revolutionising how we interact with our devices and digital services. They power many of the services we use today, including web search, content recommendations, image and speech recognition, and autonomous driving.

In conclusion, While AI and ML are intertwined, they are not the same. Machine learning is a method to achieve AI, and AI is a concept that encompasses ML. The growth of machine learning is a leap towards achieving the overarching goal of creating artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and act.
