100 Days to JS Master

Welcome to 100 Days to JS Master! In this program, you will embark on a 100-day journey to become a JavaScript master.

Each day, you will receive instructions and coding exercises that will help you improve your JavaScript skills. By the end of the program, you will have a deep understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and be able to build complex applications using this powerful language.

To make the most out of this program, we recommend dedicating a consistent amount of time each day to complete the exercises. We understand that life can get busy, so if you miss a day or two, don't worry! Just pick up where you left off and keep going.

We also encourage you to collaborate with fellow participants and share your progress on our community forum. Learning together and exchanging ideas can be a great way to enhance your learning experience.

Ready to get started? Let's dive into Day 1 and begin your journey to become a JavaScript master!

Happy coding,
