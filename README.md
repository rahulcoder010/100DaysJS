## Python

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. In this repository, we will also cover Python along with JavaScript to broaden your programming skills.

To start with Python, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

Once Python is installed, you can start writing Python programs using any IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a text editor of your choice. There are several popular IDEs available for Python, such as PyCharm, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, and many more.

Python has a clean and readable syntax that makes it easier for beginners to understand and write code. It also has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that can help you accomplish various tasks efficiently.

Throughout the 100 days of this journey, we will cover different aspects of Python programming, including variable types, data structures, control flow, loops, functions, modules, file handling, exception handling, and more.

By mastering Python alongside JavaScript, you will be able to leverage the strengths of both languages and expand your programming abilities. So, let's embark on this journey together and become well-versed in both JavaScript and Python!

Happy coding!
