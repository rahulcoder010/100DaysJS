100 Days to JS Master

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that is widely used for web development. It is a high-level, interpreted language that allows you to create dynamic and interactive websites.

With JavaScript, you can manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and create animations. It provides a wide range of built-in functions and objects that make it easy to work with data and perform complex operations. You can also write your own functions and objects to extend the functionality of JavaScript.

One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document. With JavaScript, you can access and modify the contents of a web page, such as adding or removing elements, changing their styles, or responding to user actions.

JavaScript is also commonly used for features like form validation, data processing, and AJAX requests. It has a large and active community, with plenty of resources and libraries available for you to learn and build upon.

In this 100 Days to JS Master challenge, you will immerse yourself in JavaScript and become proficient in using it for various web development tasks. Each day, you will learn new concepts, solve coding exercises, and build small projects to reinforce your understanding.
