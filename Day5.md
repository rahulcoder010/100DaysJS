# DevOps and CI/CD

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the system's development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. The culture of DevOps aims to break down the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, developers and operations. 

Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. 

CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (DevOps). Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch. 

In addition, continuous delivery extends CI by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. On the other hand, when continuous deployment is correctly implemented, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline will be released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production. 

In DevOps, CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications. With a reliable CI/CD in place, a DevOps team can confidently deliver more frequent app updates to customers, resulting in incremental improvements and quick bug fixes.
