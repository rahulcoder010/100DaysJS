def create_update_files(filename, content):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)

# Iterate over topics and create/update files
for filename, content in topics.items():
    create_update_files(filename, content)

Please note: this sample code will create or update the files with the topic names only. A real-world blog post will contain far more information. As the specific content is unknown at this point, a real implementation would involve generating or sourcing the required content programmatically.
